      Hello Functions Engineering Notebook Submission

Description: 
     I started working on Hello Functions right after I finished the first Ultrasonic Sensor project,
so I just made a copy of that code and used a function to take the distance of an object from the
sensor.

Lessons Learned:
     Coverting commands into functions is very useful. Upload functions individually first to make 
sure they work, this will make future problems much easier to solve. Put the code for the functions
at the bottom, this way it is out of the way. Now, have the logic code, with if and else statements,
at the top and your code is simplified/compacted.
