# NotSoBasicArduino

    Not so basic arduino was an arduino module that was at first review,
    and then quickly got into using arduino along with the technology
    we'll be using for the Ultrasonic Sensor Project.
    
## Hello Functions

### Description

   I started working on Hello Functions right after I finished the first Ultrasonic Sensor project,
so I just made a copy of that code and used a function to take the distance of an object from the
sensor.

### Lesson Learned

 It is very helpful to convert coded commands into functions.
Convert your commands into functions, then test each function individually
to make sure they work. This frees up space for the logic code at the top 
(w/ if and else statements). This simplifies and compacts your code, while
making problems with the code easier to fix.
