# NotSoBasicArduino

    Not so basic arduino was first review, and then quickly got into
    using arduino along with the technology we'll be using for the 
    Ultrasonic Sensor project.
    
## Hello Functions

### Description

   I started working on Hello Functions right after I finished the first Ultrasonic Sensor project,
so I just made a copy of that code and used a function to take the distance of an object from the
sensor.
