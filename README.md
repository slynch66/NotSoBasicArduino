      Hello Functions Engineering Notebook Submission

Description: 
     I started working on Hello Functions right after I finished the first Ultrasonic Sensor project,
so I just made a copy of that code and used a function to take the distance of an object from the
sensor.

Lessons Learned:  
     Using functions to compact code makes fixing problems a lot easier. You can make certain commands into functions, and put those specific functions at the bottom of your code. This way, you can upload those commands individually and make sure ahead of time that the function works. Then, the logic part of the code at the top, using ifs and elses, is simplified/compacted.
